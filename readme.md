# OSATE Headless (aka Phantom)

Phantom is a CLI-based tool that produces AADL instance models represented in [AIR](https://github.com/sireum/air).
The AIR models can then be used in 
downstream tools such as [AWAS](https://github.com/sireum/v3-awas) or [ACT](https://github.com/sireum/act-plugin).

## Installation

Execute the following commands to build Phantom

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sireum/osate-headless.git
cd osate-headless
./build.sh
```
   
## Usage

Type `phantom` (or `phantom.bat` under Windows) to view Phantom's command line options
